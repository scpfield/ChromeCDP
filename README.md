# ChromeCDP
Chrome CDP Client

Connects to a Chrome browser via WebSocket, and uses the Chrome CDP Protocol to communicate and control it.

Injects javascript modules for hooking events.

Transmits DOM and CDP event data in real-time from the browser to the client.
Displays the data in a two-panel ncurses console window.

The CDP Protocol is what a few other UI automation frameworks use for simulating mouse + keyboard events, such as Playwright, Puppeteer, etc., instead of W3C WebDriver.  Conveniently, mouse events generated by Chrome's CDP interface are not tainted.
